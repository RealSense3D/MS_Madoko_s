# Main Section

Here is a reference to [Section #header12](#header12),
or using a shorthand, to Section [#header12] which
is the same as this reference [#header12][].
Perhaps you just want the label text #myheader?

Let's set a special label for sub-sections

## header11      { #myheader } 
## header12 
#### header1201?
# header2

## header 2.1  
### header 2.1.1
