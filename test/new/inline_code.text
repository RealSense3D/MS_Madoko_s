Test `code \/ \a \\ done <test>`.
Finally, the escape sequence `\/` translates to nothing; this can be very 
useful to separate certain constructs. For example, emphasis is suppressed
if the underscores appear inside a word, as in my_example_here. Using the
empty escape sequence we can emphasize inside words too: to get
my\/_example_\/here, we can simply write `my\/_example_\/here`.
