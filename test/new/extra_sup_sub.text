Superscripts may be written by surrounding the superscripted text by ^ characters; 
subscripts may be written by surrounding the subscripted text by ~ characters. 
Thus, for example,

> H~2~O is a liquid.  2^10^ is 1024.

If the superscripted or subscripted text contains spaces, these spaces must be escaped with
backslashes. (This is to prevent accidental superscripting and subscripting
through the ordinary use of ~ and ^.) Thus, if you want the letter P with "a cat" in
subscripts, use P~a\ cat~, not P~a cat~.
