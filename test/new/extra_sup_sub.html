<p>Superscripts may be written by surrounding the superscripted text by ^ characters; 
subscripts may be written by surrounding the subscripted text by ~ characters. 
Thus, for example,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>H<sub>2</sub>O is a liquid.  2<sup>10</sup> is 1024.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If the superscripted or subscripted text contains spaces, these spaces must be escaped with
backslashes. (This is to prevent accidental superscripting and subscripting
through the ordinary use of ~ and ^.) Thus, if you want the letter P with &ldquo;a cat&rdquo; in
subscripts, use P<sub>a&nbsp;cat</sub>, not P~a cat~.</p>
