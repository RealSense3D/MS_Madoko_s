# Madoko -- a Fast Scholarly Markdown Processor

Madoko is a fast javascript [Markdown] processor written in [Koka]
It started out as a demo program for the new [Koka] language and
the name comes from "_Ma_\/rk\/_do_\/wn in _Ko_\/ka".

Madoko is a javascript program that runs on [Node.js]. It is about 30% faster
then [Marked] (one of the fastest Javascript markdown implementations), and
about 8 times faster than [Showdown] and [Markdown.js]. Madoko is also
available as a .NET executable on windows.

Even though Madoko is fast, the main design goal is not efficiency: I wanted
to extend Markdown to make it suitable to create high-quality scholarly and
industrial documents for the web and print, while maintaining John Gruber's
Markdown philosophy of simplicity and focus on plain text readability.

Besides HTML output, also generates high-quality PDF files through LaTeX. Even
though more Markdown implementations support this, there has been a lot of
effort in Madoko to make the LaTeX generation robust and customizable. This
makes it possible to write high-quality articles using just Madoko and get
both a high-quality print format (PDF) and a good looking HTML page.

For more information look at the [Madoko documentation](doc/reference.html)
in the `doc` directory.

Have fun,
